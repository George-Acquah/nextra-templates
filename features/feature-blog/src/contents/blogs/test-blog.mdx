# Understanding the Test Blog

_(This is an `h1` — the primary heading for validation)_

Welcome to the **Test Blog**. This content exists purely to confirm that your entire data flow is functional: from reading the file content on the server, to extracting frontmatter, to finally rendering the MDX body on the client.

---

## Component Rendering Validation

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is important, but for this post, **validation** is key. We need to ensure all basic Markdown elements and any custom components are loading correctly using the new `mdx-components.tsx` setup.

Without it:

- Your metadata would not be extracted.
- Custom components would throw errors.
- The build process would fail.

With it: ✅ Content is readable, ✅ metadata is accurate, ✅ system is stable.

## Test Metadata & Links

This section checks that internal and external linking works:

### Internal Links

Check out the [home page](/) or jump directly to the [Code Examples](#code-examples).
For an external reference, here’s a link to [Google](https://google.com).

## Lists for Verification

Unordered lists for testing formatting:

- File reading (`fs.readFileSync`) is successful.
- Frontmatter parsing (`gray-matter` or Next.js internal) is successful.
- Sorting by date is successful.

Ordered lists for testing structure:

1. Validate MDX parsing.
2. Confirm Client Component boundaries.
3. Deploy to production environment.

---

## Code Examples

Inline code looks like this: `npm install --workspace=@my/package`.

Block code confirms pre-formatted text rendering:

```javascript
// This block of code confirms syntax highlighting support
function validateSystem(status) {
  if (status === 'functional') {
    return true
  }
  console.log('System validation failed.')
  return false
}
```
